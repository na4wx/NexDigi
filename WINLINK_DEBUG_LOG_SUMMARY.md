# Winlink Debug Logging Summary

## Reduced Verbose Logging
The following debug messages have been suppressed to reduce terminal clutter:

- Frame event debug listeners
- Address SSID bytes parsing details  
- Channel configuration details (for enabled channels)
- "Channel not enabled" messages
- I-frame sequence number details (unless error)
- RR acknowledgment details
- "Ignoring frame on channel" messages (feedback prevention)

## Essential Logging Retained
The following important messages are still logged for Winlink debugging:

### AX.25 Protocol Events
- ✅ `SABM received` - Connection establishment
- ✅ `UA sent, connected-mode session established` - Connection confirmed
- ✅ `DISC received` - Disconnection 
- ✅ `DM response` - Disconnect acknowledgment

### B2F Protocol Sequence
- ✅ `📋 Starting RMS protocol sequence` - RMS initialization
- ✅ `📤 Sending B2F I-frame` - All RMS protocol frames with content
- ✅ `🔗 Sending CMS connection` - CMS connection confirmation
- ✅ `📋 Sending RMS SID` - System identification  
- ✅ `🔐 Sending auth challenge` - Authentication challenge
- ✅ `💬 Sending RMS prompt` - Final prompt

### Client Protocol Handling
- ✅ `🔄 B2F Protocol: Received from [client]` - All client messages
- ✅ `✅ Received FW command` - Client protocol initiation
- ✅ `✅ Received client SID` - Client system identification
- ✅ `✅ Received auth response` - Client authentication

### Error Conditions
- ✅ All I-frame sequence errors
- ✅ Connection and session errors
- ✅ Authentication failures
- ✅ Protocol state errors

This provides focused debugging for Winlink protocol issues while eliminating repetitive frame-level noise.
